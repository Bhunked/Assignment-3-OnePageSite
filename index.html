                If you have had COVID-19 you should wait to be vaccinated with your next COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after the confirmed infection. This is to optimise your vaccine protection. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection.The next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given as soon as possible after 6 months.If you have had COVID-19, you do not need to defer other vaccinations – for example, your flu vaccine. But you should not get any vaccine if you are acutely unwell (e.g., you have a fever) Read more about vaccination after testing positive to COVID-19.

                <div class="ansAll" id="ans2">
                    There are many reasons why you may choose to get your child vaccinated against COVID-19.
                    It is true that most COVID-19 infections in young children either have no symptoms, or only mild symptoms. But some children do get very sick from COVID-19, or have long term complications from COVID-19.
                    Less is known about the effects of the Omicron variant in children.
                    Vaccination is the best way to help prevent your child getting very sick. This is particularly important for children at greater risk.
                    Another reason you might consider vaccination is because of the indirect benefits to your child.
                    Vaccination might help prevent school closures and disruptions to extra-curricular activities. School and activities are important for kids’ general wellbeing.
                    Vaccination of children could also help your family and community through reduced spread of the virus.
                    Vaccination in children is effective and safe. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is safe and effective.
                    Results of a recent clinical trial demonstrate that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective and that most side effects are mild and short-term.
                    The TGA carefully evaluated available data for both vaccines to support their safety and efficacy among children.

                <div class="ansAll" id="ans3">
                    To receive the best protection against serious illness or death from COVID-19, you should get all the recommended doses for your age or individual health needs. Boosters are important to maintain this protection. Boosters are anticipated to address waning of protection against severe COVID-19 prior to winter.
                    All adults can get a booster if it’s been 6 months or longer since their last COVID-19 booster or confirmed infection (whichever is most recent) for additional protection against severe illness from COVID.
                    This is particularly recommended for people at higher risk of severe illness, including:
                  <p>
                    - Everyone 65 years and over
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    - Everyone 18 years and over with medical comorbidities, disability or complex health needs.
                  </p>
                    Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 with health conditions that put them at risk of severe illness can also get a booster dose if it’s been 6 months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection, based on an individual risk assessment with their immunisation provider.
                    Booster doses are not recommended at this time for children and adolescents aged 18 years or under who do not have any risk factors for severe COVID-19.
                    For more information on 2023 booster doses read ATAGI’s 2023 booster advice statement.

                <div class="ansAll" id="ans4">
                    To receive the best protection against serious illness or death from COVID-19, You should stay up to date with all vaccinations recommended for your age or individual health needs.
                    The ATAGI recommended doses and vaccines outlines which vaccines and doses are recommended for each age and population group.
                    Whilst partial protection against COVID-19 may be as soon as 12 days after the first dose, this protection is likely to be short lived.
                    The final dose in the primary course encourages the body to create stronger protection (immunity) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7-14 days after this dose.
                    Booster doses will make sure the protection from your primary course of COVID-19 vaccines is even stronger and longer lasting.
                    ATAGI recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults in the following groups:
                    All adults aged 65 years and over
                    Adults aged 18-64 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of sever COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs.
                    If you have had your last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection, whichever is the most recent, you should wait 6 months until you consider a 2023 booster dose.
                    While COVID-19 vaccines offer protection, you can still become ill and infect others around you, so you should continue COVIDSafe practices.

                <div class="ansAll" id="ans5">
                    There is no scientific evidence to support this. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently under review by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) cause sterilisation/infertility.
                    The TGA will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is safe and effective. This includes impacts on fertility.
                    The theory that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility is based on the disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID-19 and the Syncytin-1 protein (which help placenta development) are the same. They are not.
                    The COVID-19 vaccine, like other vaccines, works by training our bodies to develop antibodies to fight against the virus that causes COVID-19, to prevent future illness.
                    There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta.
                    In addition, there is no evidence suggesting that fertility problems are a side effect of ANY vaccine.
                    People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them.
                    The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has also provided advice for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy.

                    Autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis, are chronic (long-term) illnesses where our immune systems attack our own cells.
                    There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines can cause autoimmune diseases.

                    All vaccines approved for use in Australia are very effective at stopping people from becoming very sick if they catch COVID-19.
                    The vaccines have been thoroughly assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and found to be safe and effective. Read more about the approval of the vaccines.
                    Clinical trials and real world data show that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective to prevent severe illness with COVID-19.
                    For example, data from the United Kingdom shows that these vaccines also significantly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19, including hospitalisation and death, in older adults.

                <div class="ansAll" id="ans8">
                    No, COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA.

                    Some COVID-19 vaccine use a fragment of messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct your body to make an immune response against COVID-19. 
                    
                    There is a crucial difference between mRNA and DNA. 
                    
                    DNA, which makes up our genetic code, is larger, double stranded and very long. The mRNA is a single stranded copy of a small part of the DNA, which is often released to send instructions to other parts of the cell. 
                    
                    DNA is stored in the protected centre of our cells – the nucleus. The mRNA is broken down quickly by the body. It never enters the nucleus, and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code. 
                    
                    Instead, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines teach the cell how to make a protein that triggers an immune response specific to COVID-19. The vaccines work with the body’s natural defences to develop immunity to disease.
