# Assignment-3
 
I have really enjoyed this unit and have learnt a lot which I wish I could have incorperated into my the one page site. 

Some of the things I am proud that I have been able to achieve are: 

- Clickable buttons that reveal addition text while also highlighting when hovering over the text.
- Used different Classes and ID to target and change how text looks in CSS.
- Used Javascript to target different IDs to make them disapear by changing their size on the page.

Some things that I wish I could improve on: 

- Turn the Javascript functions into an Array to make it compact or figure out another way to make it compact.
- Space the text out more without breaking background colour.
